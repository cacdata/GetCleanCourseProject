**Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset**

**Version 1.0**

The original source of data was provided by the following:

Original source material decription:

>The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

>Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals. Also the magnitude of these three-Directional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm. 

>Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing. 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## Creation of this DataSet

This data set was created from the original source material cited above, following instructions provided by the Getting and Cleaning Data course instructions, which resulted in the following steps being done. 

1. Combined the original training and testing data sets to get full data for all 30 subjects
2. Extracted data on only the mean or standard deviation of signals.  NOTE: This did not include meanFrequncy numbers (i.e.Weighted average of the frequency components) and angle vectors.
3. Numeric enumerations for activities were mapped to descriptive names in the resultant data set.
4. Variable names were "cleaned":
- Removed parantheses, dashes, and commas which will make them unsuitable for use in many R package funcions.  Offending characters were generally replaced with underscores "_".
- Duplicated columns names in the original data set were corrected using the make.names() function.
- "t", "f", "mag" were all expanded to longer more descriptive parts of the name.
- All _std or _mean attributes were placed at the end of the name.
5. All variables were then grouped by subject (30) and activity (6) to make 180 rows with each subsequent column containing the average (mean) of that variable over the subject activity. An "avg" is prefixed to all those column headers which resulted in the data set described in this document.
